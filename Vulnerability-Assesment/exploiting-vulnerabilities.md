 we are going to be going over some means of identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused.

 you will find some publicly available resources that are essential additions to your skill set and tools when performing vulnerability research and exploitation

-----

Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

there are various vulnerability scanners ranging from commercial i.e paid to free and open source 

         the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial.

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs.

Vulnerabilies : 
1. Security Misconfigurations 

        Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.

2. Broken Access Control  
 
        This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.

3. Insecure Deserialization    

        This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed.

4. Injection   

        An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful.

 Finding Manual Exploits : 

 1. Rapid 7  :

        it is a vulnerability research database , and it also acts as a exploit database as it have all exploits available in it ,

        it also contains instructions to exploit using metasploit 

 2. Github  : 
 
        GitHub is a popular web service designed for software developers.

        here people can host and share source code 

        hackers also stores and publishes their exploits here 

        GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload


3. Searchsploit (CLI tool): 
        
        This tool is an offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your system.        

        example : searchsploit wordpress
