Extensions have all the extensions we have installed from Bapp store or from other sources 

all the extensions work in decending order 

we can use extension tab to install ,  updata , delete extensions in one place

------

The Burp App Store (or BApp Store for short) gives us a way to easily list official extensions and integrate them seamlessly with Burp Suite. Extensions can be written in a variety of languages -- most commonly Java or python 

The Request Timer extension (Written by Nick Taylor) allows us to log the time that each request we send takes to receive a response; this can be extremely useful for discovering the presence of (and exploiting) time-based vulnerabilities.

Different extensions have different behaviours: some merely add a new item to right-click context menus; others create entirely new tabs in the main menu bar.

-----

If we want to use Python modules in Burp Suite, we need to have downloaded and included the separate Jython Interpreter JAR file.

 The Jython interpreter is a Java implementation of Python. The website gives us the option to either install Jython to our system or download it as a standalone Java archive (JAR). We need it as a standalone archive to integrate it with Burp.

 Note: we can do the same thing with Ruby modules and the JRuby integration; however, we will not cover this here as: A) Python modules are much more common and B) it's exactly the same process for both.
