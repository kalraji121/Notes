manually walking through a web app via browser extensions 

tools are

view source - view human readable source code of a website 

inspector - inspect page elements , make changes to visually blocked content

debugger - manipulate javascript 

network - see all network requests a website makes

---------------------------------------------------

step 1 - walk through website , explore webpages,login forms etc. and not it down 

step 2 viewing the page source i.e human readable code like html , css , js etc. 

 <!-- and ending with --> these are comments . 

 these are HTML elements that start with ("< a"  i.e anchor elements - links us to different webpages

 link is stored in href attribute 

 we learned using comments , outdated updates using changelog , went through jss cs files to get directory listing 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

step 3 - developer tools usage 

Inspector - 

 this is a tool kit used to aid web developers in debugging web applications and gives you a peek under the hood of a website to see what is going on.

 Element inspector assists us with this by providing us with a live representation of what is currently on the website.

 we can edit remove and do various things with inspector including bypassing paywalls. 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugger - 

here we can edit , view , format all javascript related items in our code , we can add breakpoints in code by selection the line number tooo

-------------------------

Network - 

The network tab on the developer tools can be used to keep track of every external request a webpage makes

AJAX is a method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.
